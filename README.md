# Rosalind
## Practicing Python with a focus on genetics
I am an aspiring data scientist working on building up my portfolio. My first of many projects was simply to get a grasp of basic coding in Python. With the help of Rosalind, "a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving," (https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) I was able to do so. I plan to explore Python packages next--specifically those that are frequently used by data scientists.  
I am interested in working with biological data with an eye towards global climate resiliency; this is why I chose to learn through Rosalind, which has a focus on biological data. However, moving forward, I plan to work with data that I feel is more applicable to my field. My long term goal is to work in biotech in order to address environmental issues.  
## Individual Descriptions
### Counting DNA Nucleotides
Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 nt.  
Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s.  
[My Code](7_nt.py)

### Transcribing DNA into RNA
Given: A DNA string t having length at most 1000 nt.  
Return: The transcribed RNA string of t.

### Complementing a Strand of DNA
Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 bp.  
Return: The reverse complement s<sup>c</sup> of s.

### Rabbits and Recurrence Relations
Given: Positive integers n≤40 and k≤5.  
Return: The total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n months, if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair).

### Computing GC Content
Given: At most 10 DNA strings in FASTA format (of length at most 1 kbp each).  
Return: The ID of the string having the highest GC-content, followed by the GC-content of that string. Rosalind allows for a default error of 0.001 in all decimal answers unless otherwise stated; please see the note on absolute error below.

### Counting Point Mutations
Given: Two DNA strings s and t of equal length (not exceeding 1 kbp).  
Return: The Hamming distance dH(s,t).  
[My Code](12_point.py)

[Problem Description in Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/hamm/)  
### Mendel's First Law
Given: Three positive integers k, m, and n, representing a population containing k+m+n organisms: k individuals are homozygous dominant for a factor, m are heterozygous, and n are homozygous recessive.  
Return: The probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing a dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). Assume that any two organisms can mate.

### Translating RNA into Protein
Given: An RNA string s corresponding to a strand of mRNA (of length at most 10 kbp).  
Return: The protein string encoded by s.  
[My Code](14_translation.py)

[Problem Description in Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/prot/)  
### Finding a Motif in DNA
Given: Two DNA strings s and t (each of length at most 1 kbp).  
Return: All locations of t as a substring of s.  
[My Code](15_motif.py)  
[Sample Data that I Worked With](15_original.txt)  
[Problem Description in Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/subs/)  
### Consensus and Profile
Given: A collection of at most 10 DNA strings of equal length (at most 1 kbp) in FASTA format.  
Return: A consensus string and profile matrix for the collection. (If several possible consensus strings exist, then you may return any one of them.)
